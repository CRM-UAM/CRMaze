The Gcode files were generated with FlatCAM and post processed:

* all of them were mirrored vertically from bCNC
* the drill file was optimized with bCNC to reduce milling time
* manually removed the "interior" pass of FlatCAM's output, and pocketed the outer edge with bCNC (with the "cut" tool and 0.45mm depth increments)
